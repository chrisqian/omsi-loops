            I don't collect your data.

        <p>
            At all.

            Your data gets stored on your browser and the only time it leaves your browser is if you save to the Google Cloud, and in that case it's going to Google, not me.

            There is a Google Analytics snippet that reports page views, to let me know roughly how many people are using this fork, and it does not report any personal information,
            only that someone has looked at the page.
        </p>

            If you have any questions, find me on the Idle Loops discord.
